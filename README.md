### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my Github page, my name is Wojciech and my goal is to become a front-end developer.

### You can see live versions of my projects below:

<!-- # [Victoria Gaj website](http://www.victoria.mogilany.pl/)

This project is my first website I've created using React. It was created for my friend that is a coach for Victoria Gaj women football team. It features Headless CMS system that was created using Strapi. -->

# [Warheim army builder](https://vermillion-beignet-3f197a.netlify.app/)


This project is an army builder for a fantasy miniature game called Warheim. As of current day, there is no online software that allows you to create your army list outside of using pen and paper to do so. To help players around Poland in creating their armies, I've designed this website in order to help make this process much easier and faster. By using this app you can save your lists as a PDF document, save and update them.


# [Hearthstone card viewer](https://hearthstonecardviewer.netlify.app/)

This wesbite lets you to browse through Hearthstone cards from standard expansions. You can filter the cards by class and sort them by mana cost or card name. It is possible to filter the cards by any word using the 'search' box. It will show every card that has the chosen word in it's name or text box.

# [React Quiz App](https://liberadoquizapp.netlify.app/)


This project is another on my path to learning Typescript and SCSS. It's a simple quiz game that fetches questions from opentdb API. In this project, I've focused more on styling the elements, adding animations and make it better looking in general.
